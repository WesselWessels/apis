# Spelling apis

_apis_ is Latin for "bee". Pretentious, I know.

Ever woke up and thought "let's write a spelling bee game". Well, this is the result.

Very crudely thrown together. Using vanilla JavaScript only. No fancy frameworks or libraries. Could the code be better. Absolutely!

The word list is created by using books from the public domain. They were downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top). Currently, Pride and Prejudice, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and A Tale of Two Cities is used.

The word list is constructed using only lowercase words, so that pronouns aren't included. It isn't intended to be every word imaginable, but contains over 5 000 words now.

Added sentences from the books, so that you could get the word read in context. Sometimes, doesn't always help. But mostly very cool.
